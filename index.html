    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>

    <p>HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, has been around for some time now and is the backbone for all web pages.
        <br>
        Chances are that if you have visited a web page you have most likely encountered HTML. The most up to date
        version <br>
        of HTML is HTML5, which was released in October of 2014. HTML 5 adds audio, video and canvas elements allowing
        <br>
        for multimedia integration.</p>

    <h1>Building a web page.</h1>
    <br><br>

    <h4>The basic layout of an HTML file</h4>

    <p>HTML uses an easy layout format to organize the content of the web page. <br>
        The basic components of an HTML file include
    <ul>
        <li>The Doctype (<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>) is an instruction to the web
            browser about what version of the markup language the page is written in.
        </li>
        <li>The html tags (<code>&lt;html&gt;</code>) tell the web browser where your html 'code' begins
            and where it ends.
        </li>
        <li>The Header (<code>&lt;head&gt;</code>) is the behind the scenes manager for your HTML web page. <br>
            The header is where all your external library calls go as well as any setup you might do to the website.
        </li>
        <li>The Body (<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>) is where the main contents of your web page goes. This is where the
            user will spend <br>
            most of their time looking at, so don't be afraid to make it look nice!
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Getting started</h4>

    <p>Before we begin you should decide on an enviornment to write your website with. In this tutorial I will be
        using<br>
        <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> this is a lightweight text editor that highlights code
        very nicely. <br>
        This editor is not required though so feel free to choose whatever enviornment you like.
    </p>

    <h4>Your first website</h4>

    <p>
        Now that you have your enviornment set up lets begin by setting up the basis for a web page. <br>
        The following code will set up what the Document Object Model, or DOM, will see as your very own web page. <br>
        Begin by typing
        this into a new text file:<br>
    </p>

    <code><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
    </code>

    <p>The above code is what we call an HTML shell. this is the basic layout for every web page. <br>
        go ahead and save your text file as <b>index.html</b> and open your website in a browser. <br>
        Pretty plain, right? Dont worry, we will be adding content at a later time. But for now congratulations on your
        first website!</p>


    <h4>Adding content to your web page:</h4>

    <p>Now that you have your website up and running its time to start adding content to your web page. <br>
        All of your editing will be done within the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags for now. The <code>
            &lt;body&gt;</code> tag is <br>
        the front end that the user will see when visiting your web page. It is important to keep your code <br>
        orginized within this block as it can get pretty messy at times. Now, it's time to get some text onto the
        screen! <br>
        There are two basic components of html text, The title denoted by <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> will display a big
        text <br>
        this is used to divide your website into different sections. Begin by adding <code>
            &lt;h1&gt;Foo&lt;/h1&gt;</code> <br>
        into your body section of <b>index.html</b> this will add a title with the text foo to your web page. <br>
        This is great and all, but what about writing actual text that is not huge, this is done using the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
        tag. <br>
        This tag is also known as the paragraph tag allows the user to write several lines of text. This is useful for
        <br>
        getting information across to the user. As a matter of fact, the sentence you are currently reading is written
        within the <br>
        paragraph tag! Now lets add a paragraph to your website. Add the following line after your title <code>&lt;p&gt;Bar&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <br>
        Now, your website is starting to come togther! Feel free to add your own titles and paragraph. <br><br>
        Your HTML code should look like the following </p>
    <code><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;Foo&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bar&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
    </code>

    <h4>Adding images to your web page:</h4>

    <p>Todays web pages are filled with images to try and catch visitors attention. Without images, among other things,
        <br>
        todays web would look very boring. Luckily, it is easy to add images to your page! To add an image you would use
        the <br>
        <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Try adding an image by adding the following line of code to your body: <br>
        <code>&lt;img src="http://bit.ly/1i8VVBA"/&gt;</code> Notice how this image code has a src field. This tells
        your DOM <br>
        where to look for the actual image. The src field can be a local path or a path to an image on the web. Now you
        can<br>
        make your web page look pretty gnarly!<br><br>
        Your HTML code should look like this:
    </p>
    <code><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://bit.ly/1i8VVBA/&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
    </code>

    <h4>Adding links to your webpage:</h4>

    <p>As you can see, I have already added a link earlier in this tutorial, but who did I do that? Just like adding
        <br>
        images, adding a link is very easy, if not easier! To add a link, you would use the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.
        <br>
        This stands for an anchor tag and is the backbone for links on the web. Lets try try adding a link to your page!
        <br>
        Add the followig line of code: <code>&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/1LKaTfp"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;</code> Notice how we
        <br>
        are using href instead of src. href is similar to src, however it tells the web page to execute the link rather
        <br>
        than just pull information from it. Also, you can use href as a domain name or a local path. Now you can set up
        links <br>
        like a pro! <br><br>
        Your link code should look like this:
    </p>

    <code><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/1LKaTfp"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
    </code>

    <h4>Adding multimedia to your webpage:</h4>

    <p>Along with adding images to your web page, you may find it productive to add other multimedia content<br>
        such as audio and video. To add an audio file to your page you would use the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag.
        <br>
        It is worth noting that audio is not supported in all browsers. <br>
        To add video to your web page, you would use the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag. It is also worth mentioning
        that <br>
        video is not supported in all browsers. <br><br>
        The following code implements both audio and video into the website using bar.mp3 and foo_bar.mp4
    </P>
    <code><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;!-- Audio --&gt;
       &lt;audio controls&gt;
            &lt;source src="bar.ogg" type="audio/ogg"&gt;
            &lt;source src="bar.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;
            Your browser does not support the audio element.
        &lt;/audio&gt;

        &lt;!-- Video --&gt;
        &lt;video width="400" controls&gt;
            &lt;source src="foo_bar.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
            &lt;source src="foo_bar.ogg" type="video/ogg"&gt;
            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
        &lt;/video&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
    </code>
